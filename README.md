## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
map_estimate = minimize(neg_log_posterior,
                        x0,
                        method='BFGS',
                        options={'disp': True})
# Convert from logit(p) to p
p_optimal = np.exp(map_estimate['x'][0])/ (
    1.0 + np.exp(map_estimate['x'][0]))
print("MAP estimate of success probability = ", p_optimal)
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for data scientists, machine learning engineers, and data analysts who already use data science tools and libraries but want to learn more about the underlying math. Whether youâ€™re looking to build upon the math you already know, or need insights into when and how to adopt tools and libraries to your data science problem, this book is for you. Organized into essential, general, and selected concepts, this book is for both practitioners just starting out on their data science journey and experienced data scientists.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 2-15).
## Software and Hardware List
| Chapter | Software required | OS required |
| -------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| 2-15 | Python, Jupyter Notebook | Windows, macOS, or Linux |
