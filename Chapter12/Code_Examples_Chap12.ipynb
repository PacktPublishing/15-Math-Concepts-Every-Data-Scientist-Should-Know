    "## Linearly Separable DataSet Example\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start with the example data in Figure 12.1. The classes are linearly separable. We'll use a linear Fisher Discriminant to construct a classifier. A linear discriminant for a two-class problem uses the orthogonal distance of a point ${\\bf x}$ from a line ${\\bf w}$ to determine which class the point is in. If the point ${\\bf x}$ is one side of the line we say it is in class 1, whilst if it is on the other side of the line we say it is in class 2. \n",
    "\n",
    "Measuring how far a point is from the line ${\\bf w}$ is equivalent to measuring how far the point ${\\bf x}$ is along the line $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$, which is normal to the line ${\\bf w}$. So we can express the classifier as the mathematical condition $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}^{\\top}{\\bf x} > c$, where $c$ is some constant. If the point ${\\bf x}$ satisfies this condition the point is in one class, if it doesn't satisfy this mathematical condition, it is in the other class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Training the linear discriminant is the process of determining the optimal line ${\\bf w}$ which minimizes the classification error on the training dataset.  Determining the optimal line ${\\bf w}$ is equivalent to finding the optimal line $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$. Since we can see from Figure 12.1 that the two class, the red and the blue points, can be separated by a straight line we know that a linear discriminant using just the features we have, $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$, will be sufficient to achieve a high-level of accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use KFDA_Poly class I have written to train the Fisher Discriminant. The class is in the kernel_fda.py module which can be found in the same directory as this notebook. You can see we have already imported the module at the start of the notebook. The KFDA_Poly class allows you to do kernel Fisher Discriminant Analysis with pure polynomial kernels of the form $\\left ( \\underline{x}\\cdot\\underline{y}\\right )^{p}$. When calling the constructor for the KFDA_Poly class we specify the degree $p$ of the kernel we want to use. To do standard linear Fisher Discriminant Analysis, we specify degree $p=1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data for Figure 12.1 is in the file lda_ex1.csv in the Data directory of the GitHub repository. We have labelled the classes 1 and 2, rather than \"red\" and \"blue\". \n",

    "We know that the red and blue points in Figure 12.2 are separated by the boundary $x_{1}^{2} + x_{2}^{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$. So if a point $\\bf{x}$ has $x_{1}^{2} + x_{2}^{2} > \\frac{1}{2}$ it is in the red class, whilst if $\\bf{x}$ has $x_{1}^{2} + x_{2}^{2} < \\frac{1}{2}$ it is in the blue class. \n",

This classifier condition can also be written as $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}^{\\top}\\boldsymbol{\\Phi} > \\frac{1}{2}$, where $\\boldsymbol{\\Phi} = (x_{1}^{2}, x_{2}^{2}, \\sqrt{2} x_{1}x_{2})$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\beta} = (1,1,0)$. This is in the form of a linear discriminant classifier, but where we are using a new feature vector $\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}$. However, the vector $\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}$ is precisely the new feature vector that was implicitly created when we used a quadratic dot-product kernel in our Mercer's theorem example in the main text. This suggests that if we train a kernel Fisher Discriminant classifier using a quadratic dot-product kernel $f(\\bf{x}, \\bf{y}) = \\left ( \\bf{x}\\cdot \\bf{y} \\right )^{2}$ the trained classifier should be capable of perfectly separating the red and the blue points in the training data shown in Figure 12.2. Let's see. "
